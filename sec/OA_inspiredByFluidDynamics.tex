\section{Obstacle Avoidance Inspired by Fluid Dynamics (IFD)} \label{sec:IFD}
An important technique in fluid dynamics for describing flow around obstacles in two dimensions, is the use of conformal mapping \cite{milne1996theoretical,feder1997real}. One of the most common mapping is the Joukowski transformation, which allows to describe the transformation from a unit circle at the origin to any arbitrary positioned ellipse. We want to do a similar procedure by taking the algorithm described in Sec.~\ref{sec:DMM}, apply it to a unit circle and then transform the coordinate system such that the unit circle becomes an ellipse.

The algorithm in this section is described for ellipses in two dimensions, where the boundary is given as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{X}^b \subset \mathbb{R}^2 = \{ \xi \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \frac{\tilde \xi_1^2}{a_1^2} + \frac{\tilde \xi_2^2}{a_2^2} = 1 \} \label{eq:ellipse_2d}
\end{equation}
with the position $\tilde xi$ relative to the center $\xi^o$ described in the coordinate system aligned with the main axis of the ellipse $a_1$, $a_2$.\\
Furthermore, it is expected that the algorithm is  extendable to general convex obstacles in $d$ dimensions. % r the description of the velocity, Cartesian and cylindric coordinates are used, the conversion is given as follows:

\subsection{Algorithm}
The modulation of the DS with a convex obstacle has been described in \ref{eq:modMatrix}. It was furthermore observed, that this algorithm did perform well with a circle but has limitations with more complex obstacles. We will therefore base the new algorithm on this local modulation of a unit circle. The level function $\Gamma(\tilde \xi)$ used to caclulate the eigenvalues in (\ref{eq:eigValues}) is given for the unit circle as:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\tilde \xi) = \| \tilde \xi \|^2 \label{eq:levelCircle}
\end{equation}
The coordinate system, is then scaled with the value of the main axis of the ellipse $a_1$ and $a_2$. The level function for this new ellipse obstacle is now given as:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\tilde \xi) = \frac{\tilde \xi_1^2}{a_1^2} +  \frac{\tilde \xi_2^2}{a_2^2} \label{eq:levelEllipse}
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Theorem 1}
\textit{Consider a linear stretching of space such that a unit spherical obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with center ${}_c \xi^o$ and radius ${}_cr^o = 1$, with surface $\mathcal{X}^b \subset \mathbb{R}^2  = \{ \xi \in \mathbb{R}^2: \| \xi - {}_c\xi^o \| = 1\}$, is transformed into an ellipse defined in (\ref{eq:ellipse_2d}). Any tangent  on the unit circle ${}_c \vec{e}_i$ which is transformed in such a way, will be a tangent on the ellipse (${}_e \vec{e}_i$). This is not the case for normal vectors on the circle surface ${}_c \vec{n}$,  which are not normal to the ellipse after transformation.}\\
\textbf{Proof:} See Appendix~\ref{sec:proof1} \\
${}$ \hfill $\blacksquare$\\

%Any transformation $\mathcal{X}^o \rightarrow \mathcal{X}^s : \mathcal{X}^d \leadsto \mathcal{X}^d$ which keeps a closed hyper-surface intact and ensures a smooth first order Jacobian will transform a tangent of the later hyper-surface to a tangent in the new space.
Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison_behaviour} illustrates the tangent (green) and the normal (red) before and after transformation for both the IFD, additionally it shows it for the DMM around the same ellipse. \\
At this point, we introduce the unit circle reference frame (CRF) which is indicated by indice ${}_c (\cdot)$ and the ellipse reference frame (ERF) with the indice ${}_e(\cdot)$. \\
It can be observed, that the tangent on the circle ${}_c \vec e_1(\tilde \xi)$ is a tangent of the ellipse after the transformation ${}_e \vec e_1(\tilde \xi)$. On the other hand, the normal on the circle ${}_c \vec n (\tilde \xi)$ is not a normal on the ellipse after the transformation.This transformed normal on the unit circle will further be referred to as \textit{pseudo normal} $\hat{\vec n} (\tilde \xi)$  in the ellipse space and is given as:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\vec n }(\tilde \xi) = {}_e\vec n_{c} (\tilde \xi) =   \frac{1}{\sqrt{ {}_e\tilde \xi_1^2 + {}_e \tilde \xi_2^2}}
  \begin{bmatrix}
     {}_e\tilde \xi_1 \\
     {}_e\tilde \xi_2
   \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The modulation matrix in (\ref{eq:modMatrix}) needs to be adapted to for the IFD. And we get a new modulation matrix $\hat M$:
\begin{equation}
\hat M = \hat E(\tilde \xi)  D(\tilde \xi) \hat E^{-1}(\tilde \xi)\label{eq:modMatrix_IFD}
\end{equation}IFw
The normal in $E(\xi)$ is replaced with the pseudo normal in $\hat E(\tilde)$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat E(\tilde \xi) = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\vec n}(\tilde \xi) & \vec e_1(\tilde \xi) \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The basis vectors for the IFD which construct $\hat E$ are not necessarily orthogonal, but only linearly independent.

The modulation of the DS follows analogous to (\ref{eq:modulatedDS}) as:
\begin{equation}
  \dot \xi = \hat{M}(\xi) f(\xi) \label{eq:modulatedDS_IFD}
\end{equation}

\\ \noindent\textbf{Theorem 2}
\textit{Consider a 2-dimensional elliptic obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as given in (\ref{eq:ellipse_2d}). Any motion $\{\xi\}_t$, $t = 0 .. \infty$ that starts outside the obstacle, i.e. $ \frac{(\{\xi_1\}_0 - \xi_1^o)^2}{a_1^2} + \frac{(\{\xi_2\}_0 - \xi_2^o)^2}{a_2^2} > 1  $ and evolves according to (\ref{eq:modulatedDS_IFD}) never penetrates into the obstacle, i.e.$ \frac{(\{\xi_1\}_t - \xi_1^o)^2}{a_1^2} + \frac{(\{\xi_2\}_t - \xi_2^o)^2}{a_2^2} > 1 $.} \\
\textbf{Proof:} See Appendix~\ref{sec:proof2} \\
${}$ \hfill $\blacksquare$


While impenetrability of the obstacle could already be ensured by the DMM, a limitation of the later was the observation of local minima on the surface of ellipse shaped obstacles. The IFD was designed to overcome this limitation, where it does no create local minima on the ellipse surface. The goal is to remove the local extrema, but it could be shown, that a smooth vector field in a sphere world must have at least as many extrema as obstacles \cite{koditschek1990robot}. In the optimal case this extrema can be turned into a saddle point, where points on one line converges to it. With our current modulation matrix $\hat M(\tilde \xi)$ and in a linear DS $f_l$, all the points on this saddle point trajectory have an initial DS which points directly in direction of the pseudo normal $\hat{\vec n}$. As a result of this, the modulation with $\hat M(\xi)$ only causes a change in magnitude of the velocity, but does not turn the velocity to the right or left. The saddle point trajectory is given by:
% \begin{equation}
%   \begin{split}
%   \mathcal{X}^s \subset \mathbb{R}^2 = \{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^2: &\frac{1}{\|f_l(\xi)\|} f_l(\xi) = - \hat{\vec n}(\tilde \xi),\\
%   & \|\xi - \xi^a\| > \| \xi - \xi^o\| \} \label{eq:centerLine}
%   \end{split}
% \end{equation}.\\

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \mathcal{X}^s \subset \mathbb{R}^2 = \{\xi \in \mathbb{R}^2: \; f_l(\xi) \parallel \hat{\vec n}(\tilde \xi), \} \label{eq:centerLine}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}.\\

\noindent \textbf{Theorem 3}
\textit{Consider a time invariant, linear DS $f_l(\xi)$ with a single attractor placed at $\xi^a$ given by (\ref{eq:DS_lin}). The DS is modulated according to (\ref{eq:modulatedDS_IFD}). Any motion $\{\xi\}_t$ that starts outside the obstacle and is not on the saddle point trajectory as given in (\ref{eq:centerLine}) i.e. $\{ \{\xi\}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d \setminus \mathcal{X}^s \; : \; \Gamma(\{\xi\}_0) \geq 0\}$ will move around the obstacle and converge to the attractor $\xi^a$.} \\
\textbf{Proof:} See Appendix~\ref{sec:proof3} \\
${}$ \hfill $\blacksquare$ \\
Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison_behaviour} shows very well, at every point in space the DS is modulated in the right direction, such that it doe not converge to a local minimum as could be observed with the DMM.

\vspace{1ex} \noindent
\textbf{No Change of the Tangential Velocity:}
Moreover, the sufficient condition for convergence for the eigenvalues is:  $\lambda_n(\tilde \xi) < \lambda_1 (\tilde \xi)$. This allows more flexibility in their choice than what is proposed by \cite{khansari2012dynamical,}. Under the intention to modify the DS as little as possible while pensuring impenetrability, the eigenvalue corresponding to the tangent in (\ref{eq:eigValues}) is set to one ($\lambda_1 = 1$). The initial value is an result of the incompressibility condition of the fluid,  which needs to accelerate the DS in tangential direction to get the same flow volume through a smaller area. This is not necessary for our application of the obstacle avoidance in robotics.\footnote{Keeping the incompressibility condition might be of interest, when controlling a swarm of robots around an obstacle to avoid them from colliding.}


\section{Comparison}
A good performance in a DS with four static obstacles is achieved with the IFD, where most trajectories converge to the global minimum (Fig.~\ref{fig:singleAttractor_severalObstacles_time}). On the other hand, the elongated ellipses poses a problems for the DMM as a local minimum is formed on the surface of the largest one (southwest), but also for the smaller one the algorithm does not seem to perform well. Moreover, several ellipses and narrow pathways are handles very well by both algorithms.

\end{figure}

The avoidance of an arbitrary placed circular obstacle is easily avoided with both algorithms (Fig.\ref{fig:static_circle}). In fact, no real difference of the behavior can be observed and this was expected, because the IFD uses the DMM on a circular obstacle as a starting evaluation. Only for more complex shapes, a difference and also the advantage of the IFD can be observed.

% \vspace{1ex} \noindent
% \textbf{Emergency Exiting:}
% While in continuous time and space the robot will never enter the surface, this is not ensured in with discrete integration. If during a simulation, the robot enters the safety margin of an obstacle, the algorithm switches to the emergency mode. In this mode the robot moves away from the center as follows:
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{bmatrix}
% \dot{\bar{\xi}}_r \\
% \dot{\bar{\xi}}_{\theta}
% \end{bmatrix}
% =
% \begin{bmatrix}
% v_{exit} \\
% 0
% \end{bmatrix}
% \qquad \forall \; \xi_r < R
% \end{equation}
% with $v_{exit}$ being a constant exiting velocity.

% \subsubsection{Ellipse Obstacle}
% The extension to ellipse obstacles can be done by applying a transformation to the whole space, that in the new space the object is a circle. The position and velocity are scaled in the following way:
% \begin{equation}
% {\xi}_{circ} = A^{-1} \cdot {\xi}_{ellips} \hspace{1cm} \dot{\xi}_{circ} = A^{-1}  \cdot \dot{\xi}_{ellips}
% \end{equation}
% with the linear matrix $A$ as a function of the ellipse axis $a$ and $b$
% \begin{equation}
%   A =
%   \begin{bmatrix}
%     a & 0 \\
%     0 & b
%   \end{bmatrix}
% \end{equation}
% The obstacle in the new space is a unit circle and the modulation seen in Subsection~\ref{sec:basicCircle} can be applied. \\
% The modulated DS $\dot{\bar{\xi}}_{circ}$ has then to be transformed back to the original space:
% \begin{equation}
% \dot{\bar{\xi}}_{ellips} = A  \cdot \dot{\bar{\xi}}_{circ}
% \end{equation}

% \subsubsection{Rotated Cylinder}
% If a cylinder is not aligned with the coordinated axis, the space is rotated around the origin:
% \begin{equation}
% \xi_{alligned} = R(\phi) \cdot \xi_{rot} \hspace{1cm} \dot{\xi}_{alligned} = R(\phi)  \cdot \dot{\xi}_{rot}
% \end{equation}
% with the rotation matrix $R(\phi)$ as a function of the ellipse's orientation $\phi$.

% The modulated DS is rotated back to the original space:
% \begin{equation}
% \dot{\bar{\xi}}_{rot} = R^{T}  \cdot \dot{\bar{\xi}}_{alligned}
% \end{equation}

% \subsubsection{General Position}
% A cylinder at general position can be easily observed by a translation of the coordinate system:
% \begin{equation}
% \xi_{centered} = \xi - \xi_0
% \end{equation}
% with the $\xi_0$ being the vector to the center of the ellipse. \\
% The velocity is not affected by a coordinate transformation, therefore no reverse operation is required.

% \vspace{1ex} \noindent

% %\input{input/nonpeneetrability_ellipse}
% \\

% \subsubsection{Moving Object}
% The movement of an obstacle is taken into account by changing the frame of reference to the velocity reference frame (ORF). This affects the DS in following way:
% \begin{equation}
% \dot{\tilde{\xi}}=  \dot{\xi} + \dot{\xi}^{obs}
% \end{equation}
% The position vector is not affected by the movement. \\

% The modulated DS is transformed back to the inertial reference frame (IRF):
% \begin{equation}
% \dot{\bar{\xi}} =  \dot{\tilde{\bar{\xi}}} - \dot{\xi}^{obs}
% \end{equation}

% \vspace{1ex} \noindent
% \textbf{No Wake Effect Behind Obstacle}
% As a result of the incompressible liquid asssumption, there is  a wake effect behind an obstacle. The fluid modulated to move tangential to the surface, while it could move away from it without collision.\footnote{This is also referred as \textif{tail effect} in other algorithms \cite{khansari2012dynamical}}  In the extreme case, a robot on the obstacles boundary might be pulled along with the moving obstacle. \\
% The wake effect is reduced, by modifying the velocity in normal direction only if it is moving towards the obstacle. This is done by modifying the first eigenvalue:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lambda_1(\tilde \xi) =
%   \begin{cases}
%     f(\tilde \xi) \quad &  \text{if} \; \; n(\tilde \xi)^T \cdot \dot \xi < 0 \\
%     1 \quad & \text{otherwise} %n(\tilde \xi)^T \cdot \dot \xi \geq 0 \\
%   \end{cases}
% \end{equation}

% \subsubsection{Rotating Ellipse} \label{sec:rotatingEllipse}
% A rotation of an object is treated in a similar way as a moving object, where the original DS is represented in the rotating frame of reference. The instantaneous velocity of the object is considered at the robot's position:
% \begin{equation}
% \dot{\xi}_{ellipse}^{obs}(\xi) =
% \begin{bmatrix}
% d \cdot \dot \phi \\
% 0
% \end{bmatrix}
% \end{equation}
% with the $d$ the distance of the robot to the center and $\dot \phi$ the angular velocity of the object. This latter is handled in the same way as a velocity of an object, but its value dependends on the position. Moreover, the angular velocity needs to be evaluated before the linear stretching of space.

% \vspace{1ex} \noindent
% \textbf{No Turbulence Outside Largest Axis Radius}
% A rotating ellipse in an incompressible fluid causes turbulence even beyond the largest axis. This is an undesired effect as it does not help the collision avoidance. \\
% The algorithm is therefore adapted to consider the angular rate of an object if and only if it's within the radius of the largest axis of the object, but is not considered far away. To create a smooth DS, a transition region is chosen where the two options are interpolated (Fig.~\ref{fig:trans_rotEllipse}).

% \vspace{1ex} \noindent
% \textbf{Impenetrability}
% The condition of staying in the ORF which ensures nonpenetrability (sec.~\ref{sec:basicCircle}) is not met in favor of minimizing the wake effect and turbulence. Nonpenetrability can still be ensured, because the ORF is always chosen when the DS represented in the ORF is moving towards the object. \hfill $\blacksquare$
% \vspace{1em}

% \subsubsection{Several Objects}
% As the superposition of a harmonic function is again a harmonic function, the  DS can be modulated on each obstacle separately and superposed afterwards.  This results in a function without local minima away from the boundaries, but does not satisfy the impenetrability condition. To resolve this, in regions close to an obstacle all modulated DS, apart from the one of the closest obstacle, are modulated and superposed. The modulation of the last obstacle is then applied on this superposed DS. Between the regions far away and close, there is an interpolation region to generate a smooth transition of the DS (Fig.~\ref{fig:trans_severalEllipse}). The DS for several static obstacles is therefore given as:
% \begin{equation}
%   \dot{\bar \xi} =
%   \begin{cases}
%     f_{mod,k}(\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n \neq k} \dot{\bar \xi}_n) & \text{close to obstacle k}\\
%     \frac{1}{N} \sum_n \dot{\bar \xi}_n \quad & \text{far away} \\
%     \text{transition / interpolation} \quad & \text{otherwise}
%   \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% with $N$ the number of obstacles and $F_{mod,k}$ the IRF procedure applied on the obstacle $k$ as described above.

% \vspace{1ex} \noindent
% \textbf{Impenetrability}
% Impenetrability can be ensured only when there is a finite space between two obstacles. Close to obstacles, the closest obstacle is considered on a general DS and the previous proof of Sec.~\ref{sec:basicCircle} can be applied.  \hfill $\blacksquare$

% \label{fig:transBoundary}
% \end{figure}
% This algorithm is limited to static obstacles and needs to be extended to moving obstacles.

% \subsubsection{Concave Objects}
% The algorithm extension for concave objects has not been implemented yet. A suggestion by the author is to describe any concave object as a combination of ellipses. The surface of these ellipses in the concave region could be represented as fluid dynamic equivalent of a continuous line distribution of vortexes. This will add a tangential velocity in direction away from the point of intersection. This tangential velocity is inverse proportional to the distance to the surface of the object. Therefore, it has an infinite value on the surface. The direction of the velocity vector on the surface is therefore tangential to the surface on the obstacle boundary. The DS will not penetrate the obstacle.  \\ %\vspace{1ex}

% % \subsection{Results}
% The avoidance of an arbitrarily positioned circular obstacle is successfully mastered by the IRF algorithm (Fig.~\ref{fig:oneStaticCirc_IFD}). The obstacle trajectory avoid the obstacle on both sides and it resembles natural flow.
% %\subsubsection{Static Limit Cycle}
% The IRF can avoid several obstacles when being placed in a nonlinear DS with a limit cycle  (Fig.~\ref{fig:limitCicle_twoObst_IFD_time0}). The ellipse form of the initial limit cycle can still be identified far away from the obstacles and the trajectories move close to the obstacle boundaries when it is close to them.

% \subsubsection{Two Moving Obstacles}
% All trajectories safely avoid the moving and rotating obstacles with IFD (Fig.~\ref{fig:twoMovingRotatingObs_IFD}). Additionally, the vector field seems to split evenly to go in front of or behind the obstacles, but in front of the obstacle most trajectories avoid the obstacle with at a larger distance. Furthermore, it seems that the trajectories are only influenced by the rotation of the obstacle, when they are within the radius of the largest axis. Additionally, there is no wake behind the obstacles. The minimum of the DS doesn't align with the real attractor (star).

% Moving and rotating can disturb an object, even if it is placed at the point of attraction.\\
% This is the result of the algorithm, with which the DS is modulated in the object frame. The transformed DS is not zero anymore, and the inertial modulated system won't be either. This in stabilized the point of attracted. It to consider, whether this is wanted or whether the object should stay rock still at the point of attraction.
