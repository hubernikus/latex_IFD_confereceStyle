\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
First I would like to thank for Prof. Aude Billard for giving me the possibility to work on this project, but also the critical analysis and great inputs during discussion. \\
Furthermore I would like to thank Leonardo Urbano for the support with difficult questions and the availability whenever there where questions. \\
Additionally, I am very grateful to Etienne Droz for his availability and knowledge about fluid dynamics. His enthusiasm and the refreshing discussion motivated to try and explore new algorithms interacting in different domains. \\
Finally my family and beloved parents are not to forget, who are always very supporting when help is needed.
